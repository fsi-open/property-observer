# FSi PropertyObserver Component

PropertyObserver is a simple component which tracks changes in registered object's properties. It's usefull if i.e. we want to
check if some property of some object has changed since it was last checked.

## Setup and autoloading ##

We highly recommend to use autoloader generated by composer.phar

**Adding reflection into composer.json**

    {
        ... 
        "require": {
            ... 
            "fsi/property-observer": "0.9.*" 
            ...
        },
        ...
    }

## Usage ##

Let's assume we have some ``$object`` and we want to check if value of its ``name`` property has changed between point A
and point B in our code.

```php
use FSi\Component\PropertyObserver\PropertyObserver

$object = new SomeObjectClass();
$object->setName('some name')

// point A
$observer = new PropertyObserver();
$observer->saveValue($object, 'name');

// a lot of complex code

// point B
if ($observer->hasValueChanged($object, 'name')) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}
```

The whole magic behind mapping propery names to getters/setters (if necessary) is done by symfony/property-access under the hood.
